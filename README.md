My name is @OnionTaco992

I like modding Doom.

I plan on learning how to code/program although I do not currently have a powerful enough computer to do anything significant.

You can contact me via oniontacocontact@gmail.com

I do not care much about my pronouns, although I am male, so mine would be he/him. I don't really care if you refer to me as something else though.

You might find me on other sites (Doomworld, Reddit etc)
